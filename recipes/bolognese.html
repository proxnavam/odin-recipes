    <h2>Description</h2>
    <body>Bolognese is a rich, meat-based sauce from the Bologna region of Italy, traditionally made with ground meat (like beef or pork), a soffritto of onions, carrots, and celery, and a small amount of tomatoes. It is slow-cooked to develop a deep flavor and a thick, creamy texture, often with the addition of milk or wine, and is typically served with broad pasta like tagliatelle.

        <li>1 large onion, minced.</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces.</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>½ pound ground pork.</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes.</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced.</li>
        <li>6 ounces tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>2 carrots, shredded.</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped.</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine.</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken stock.</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil.</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano.</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>1 pound pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Serve sauce over hot pasta.</li>
